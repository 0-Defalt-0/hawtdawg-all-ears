#FAQ

## How many photos can I post?

We know you want to show your furry face so 
we have made the upload limit to 15

For those who are camera shy we recommend at-
least posting one photo for getting your profile
some attention

showcase your best self wheather that means a 
fresh-from-the-grommer glamour shot or an action
shot from your last game of fetch

## Where do I list my favourite treats?

open the Hawt Dwag app and click on "Edit Profile."

Scroll down to the section called "Passions" and tell 
potential mates and friends all about the treats and toys 
that make your tail wag.

When you're done, click "Save changes" to show the world.
